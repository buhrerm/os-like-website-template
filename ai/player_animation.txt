Create for me a tsx animation component that has teh following capabilities:

Visual:
This component is an animation of a record player, seen from the side. It is tilted slightly upwards so you can see the 3d animation of the record

For style of this animation, make it miami vice / old school anime

The playing animation should be distinct and noticable
The background should be transparent.


Functionality: 
When hitting play, needle drops down onto record
When polaying, the record constantly spins
When stopping, needle goes off record
When switching stations, record gets removed from player and a new one is placed down.

The component should take into it play, pause, if the record is switched.
